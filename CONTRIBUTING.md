### If you found a bug, and you want to fix it :+1:

If you spot a problem with the FeatBit, search if an [issue](https://github.com/featbit/featbit/issues) already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

You can join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/featbit/shared_invite/zt-1ew5e2vbb-x6Apan1xZOaYMnFzqZkGNQ) and tell us that you want to fix the issue you create. We will assign the issue to you that no one else will work on it at the same time. 

### If you want to fix an existing issue

1. Scan through our existing [issues](https://github.com/featbit/featbit/issues) to find one that interests you. 
2. Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/featbit/shared_invite/zt-1ew5e2vbb-x6Apan1xZOaYMnFzqZkGNQ) and tell us which issue you want to fix. 
3. We will assign the issue to you so that no one else will work on it simultaneously. 

But of course, you can fix the issue without telling us.

### If you have some feature suggestions, and you want to contribute

1. Create a new thread in [Discussion](https://github.com/featbit/featbit/discussions/categories/feature-suggestions) with the detail of your suggestion.

But of course, you can finish your contribution and create a PR without notifying us in advance.
