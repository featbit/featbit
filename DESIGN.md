2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. We do not have any design files in place yet so feel free to create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions
