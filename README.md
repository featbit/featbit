## About FeatBit

[FeatBit](https://www.featbit.co) is an open-source [feature flags](https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2022/06/16/feature-flags/) management tool that empowers developers:

**Ship Code Safely**. Mitigate risks with Production Testing, roll out features to 1% of users initially then expanding progressively, and ensure instant error recovery without redeployment.

**Targeted Experiences**. Giving you control over who sees each feature and when they see it. Release features to specific target users, and continuously measure and improve your business.

**Innovate Faster**. Decouples code deployments from feature releases. Deploy at will, and release any feature immediately upon request from the boss.

**Host Anywhere**. FeatBit allows you to host your feature flags service wherever your business needs it, ensuring compliance and data protection.

**Born for developers**. Use simple if/else statements to control and release features, eliminating complex DevOps tasks. This enables developers to directly drive business value.

## Get started in 3 steps

### 1. Start FeatBit

To self-host FeatBit with Docker, Run this script:

```
git clone https://github.com/featbit/featbit
cd featbit
docker compose up -d
```

Once all containers have started, you can access FeatBit's portal at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and log in with the default credentials:

- Username: **test@featbit.com**
- Password: **123456**

> **Note**
> By default, FeatBit's portal is only accessible from the local machine where Docker Compose is running. If you want to make it publicly accessible, refer to the [**FAQ**](https://docs.featbit.co/installation/faq#how-to-make-featbit-portal-accessible-publicly) for instructions.

### 2. Connect an SDK

Find your preferred SDK in our list of [official SDKs](https://docs.featbit.co/sdk/overview) and import it into your project. Follow the setup guides for your specific SDK.

You can also learn how to connect an SDK in the "Getting Started" section after logging in to the Portal for the first time.

### 3. Check a feature flag

To check the state of a feature flag in your code, you just need a simple function call to verify the expected value. Here's how it might look in C#:

```csharp
var user = FbUser.Builder("tester-id").Name("tester").Build();
if (featbit.BoolVariation("user-new-algorithm", user, defaultValue: false))
{
    // run new algorithm
}
else
{
    // run old algorithm
}
```
