**FeatBit** is a scalable and high-performance **Feature Management** platform. Our mission statement is to **Empower all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software**.

Our first task is to reduce the cost of self-research for everyone, an open source tool to better achieve the following works：

- Testing in production
- Targeted & Progressive release
- Entitlement Management & Software monetization
- Progressive Experimentation
- Beta testing and qualitative feedback
- Data Rollback & Cloud Migration
- Faster incident resolution
- etc.

FeatBit started with a consensus that We use open source to make software innovation faster.

## Getting Started
