## Introduction

Feature flag is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over when and which end-users see which features. FeatBit enables teams to use feature flags on a massive scale across various use cases, such as: 

- Shipping software safer and faster by progressively rolling out features to target users without redeployment.

- Measuring the impact of featuresâ€™ rollouts and running A/B tests to improve feature quality.

- Giving Sales, CS, and Marketing the ability to fine-tune target audiences and manage customer entitlement.
