## Introduction

Feature flag is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over when and which end-users see which features. FeatBit enables teams to use feature flags on a massive scale across various use cases, such as: 

- Shipping software safer and faster by progressively rolling out features to target users without redeployment.
- Measuring the impact of featuresâ€™ rollouts and running A/B tests to improve feature quality.
- Giving Sales, CS, and Marketing the ability to fine-tune target audiences and manage customer entitlement.

## Why FeatBit

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours building their own feature management platforms in-house. The other 99% are left paying for expensive 3rd party SaaS tools or hacking together unmaintained open source libraries.

We want to give all companies the flexibility and power of a fully-featured in-house feature management platform without needing to build it themselves.
