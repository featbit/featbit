## Introduction

**FeatBit** provides a feature management platform that empowers all team to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software. It enables teams to use feature flags on a massive scale across various use cases, such as:

-	Reduce delivery risk by progressively releasing features to targeting users without redeployment.

-	Measure the impact of features’ rollouts and run A/B tests to improve feature quality.

-	Enable Sales and CS to close more deals with demos and feature trials at the push of a button.

-	Give Marketing the ability to fine-tune target audiences, manage customer programs, etc.
