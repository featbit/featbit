FeatBit is a scalable and high-performance **Feature Management** platform that empowers all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software - a free replacement for Launchdarkly, Unleash and more.  

FeatBit provides a holistic framework for **Feature Flag** driven development, **A/B testing**, and experimentation, enabling teams to use flags on a massive scale across various use cases.

FeatBit empowers:

- Engineering teams to 

  - Reduce delivery risk & lower deployment stres
  - Achieve continuous delivery and Speed-up feature release
  - Enable experimental feature development and trunk-based development
  
- Help product managers to improve user experience by fine-grained targeting for who sees what experiences and when, measuring the impact of features’ rollouts, and running A/B tests to improve feature quality.
- Enable Sales and Customer Success to close more deals with live demos and feature trials at the push of a button.
- Help Support debug exactly which features and tests a customer has for faster resolution.
- Give Marketing and Design the ability to fine-tune target audiences, coordinate announcements, and manage special customer programs.
- Empower finance teams quickly get the billing report of how customers used and paid for the different features and subscriptions.
- Etc.
