# What is Featbit?

Initially, FeatBit is an infrastructure-level system for Feature Flags (a modern engineering technology). 

With feature flags, you can deploy your applicationâ€™s new features to production in smaller batches. You can toggle a feature on and off to subsets of users, helping you achieve Continuous Delivery. Feature flags help reduce risk, allowing you to do controlled testing, separate feature delivery from customer launch, and speed-up feature release.

After the BizDevOps concept appeared, many non-engineering teams at FeatBit's customers were using Feature Flags for business-valuable operations such as Qualitative feedback, giving Marketing and Design the ability to fine-tune target audiences, Entitlement management, etc.

FeatBit provides an infrastructure-level Feature Flags service, and also empowers all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software.
